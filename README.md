## 1. 🌟 What Is This Repository?
Welcome to **PulkitSood_leetcode-solutions**! This repository houses my comprehensive set of LeetCode problem solutions, amassed during a dedicated 6-month practice session. Along the way, I tackled algorithms, data structures, and coding patterns—all documented in a consistent, easy-to-follow manner.

## 2. 🎯 Why Was This Directory Created?
During the pandemic lockdown, I set an ambitious goal:  
**“Strengthen my problem-solving by methodically completing LeetCode’s extensive question bank.”**

While doing so, I also wanted to:
1. **Demonstrate** structured coding practices  
2. **Develop** a reliable reference for typical algorithmic challenges  
3. **Record** my progression from basic array manipulations to advanced dynamic programming

## 3. 🏗️ Repository Structure & File Types
Every folder contains:
- **`readme.md`**: problem statement and context  
- **`notes.md`**: Time and space complexity analysis  
- **`.java`** : My final solution implementation

Feel free to explore them in the order that interests you the most.
